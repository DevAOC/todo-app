## Problem Domain

We are tasked with using starter code to make an app that is a todo list. This app should be able to use context to modify what is viewable on the web page. There must be a hide, numberOfItems, and sort state. These are not to be modified by the user and instead are set manually. There should be the use of pagonation to limit the amount of items displayed at once.
